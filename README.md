# GoLangSampleAPI

To use this code make sure you have your golang environment, file path, etc configured
Also I recommend using the RESTClient browser extension for implementing 

The comments referring to Dbs are what the code would look like if I hadn't used mock data

Things to improve:
-I'd probably change the data types to something that could be queried since dbs wouldnt 
have the dates as strings for example
-Create Mongo database with actual collections to take it a step further

Things I like:
-Full CRUD
-Topic is more interesting (rapper)
-I have all albums in there even as mock data
